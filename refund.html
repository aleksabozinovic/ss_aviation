        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>
          The services by SS Aviation shall be subject to the refunds under the
          following terms. We only accept payment methods that are valid for our
          services and all refunds will be credited back using the same method
          of payment. By submitting your order, you authorize us to charge your
          credit card or account, including taxes, shipping, handling, and any
          agreed-upon amounts. If we are unable to verify or accept your payment
          method, your order may be automatically suspended or canceled.
        </p>

        <p>
          An invoice will be sent to you after the requested services are
          executed, and it will be considered an official payment request unless
          otherwise agreed upon. We warrant that services provided to clients
          will be performed professionally and properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you request it, we will charge your account or credit card for the
          amount agreed upon under the executed contract or as otherwise agreed
          upon by the parties. If a flight is delayed at the client's request,
          we will not be responsible for any costs incurred by the delay unless
          agreed upon in writing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not offer refunds for hardware, software, maintenance, and
          support services once agreed upon by the client. If the third party
          services provider or carrier disputes an invoice in good faith, they
          must provide written details of the disputed element within 30 days of
          receiving the invoice. Until resolved, the carrier cannot delay
          payment of the invoice but can withhold payment of the disputed
          element.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to change the payment and refund policy terms and
          conditions at any time, and any such changes will take effect when
          posted on the website or directly communicated with the client.
