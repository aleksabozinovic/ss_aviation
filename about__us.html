            When people go to the theater and watch a production, they focus on
            the actors performing on stage. Few pay any mind to the backstage
            crew, costume designers, makeup artists, and lighting specialists
            behind the curtain. But the truth is, those people are just as
            important when it comes to delivering an amazing production that
            wows the audience. Similarly, when people think of air travel, they
            often picture those at the forefront of an airline company–pilots
            and cabin crew members. However, there are a host of people
            operating behind the scenes that make air transport operations
            possible. We are those people. From cleaning services and bookings
            to cargo and security, SS Aviation is the manpower behind a well
            functioning airport.
